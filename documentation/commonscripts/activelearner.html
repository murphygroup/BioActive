			<h2>Active Learning Functions</h2>

			<p>The purpose of the active learning functions provided in the BioActive project is to guide experimentation such that predictions with the least confidence mapping the experimental space are chosen in the next round of experimentation, thus ensuring that only experiments that add the most information to the model are conducted.</p>

			<h2>Discrete variable active learning functions</h2>

			<p>The active learning file is called "actLearn_contModularized.py". If a campaign uses this active learner, it must specify in its createCampaign file the attribute "confCount = x" where x is an integer indicating the number of experiments to run each round.</p>

			<h2>Continuous variable acive learning functions</h2>

			<p>There is a separate active learning file called "actlearn_contProto.py" that is used for the "contProto" campaign only. Typically, an active learner decides what points to experiment on next based on the estimated confidence of the current model on each point. Since the independent variables are continuous, it is not feasible to estimate the confidences of every single point (tuple of independent variable values). Instead, this active learner only estimates the confidences of a random sample of 100 points.</p>

			<h2>Categorical variable active learning function</h2>

			<p>The principle behind all active learning functions is the same so the differences between the continuous variable active learning functions and the categorical variable active learning functions are quite subtle, however, in the case of the categorical active learning function, "actLearn_cat.py" is better equipped for a series of confidences in which there is more heterogeneity as is the case with the clustering algorithm, "catModel11.py"</p>
